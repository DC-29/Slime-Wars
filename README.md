# Slime Wars

## Description
This is a game I made in a week with a random prompt generator, the prompt being "You are the Powerhouse." It is a vampire survivors inspired top-down shooter. You must survive for 10 minutes to win.
The game features abilities that consume your health if you want to use them. It also has 3 different enemy types, 1 boss and 4 different passive upgrades.

## How to play
You can find this game on itch for free at https://dc2929.itch.io/slime-wars
Use WASD to move, mouse to shoot and R to reload. You can dash using L-shift and use your special using X. They consume health.
